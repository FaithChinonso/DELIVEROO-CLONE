# Quench
Building a food ordering application using React Native, React Navigation, Tailwind CSS, and Redux, with a content management system powered by Sanity. The app serves as a platform for different restaurants to showcase their individual cuisines, allowing customers to order from their preferred restaurant and proceed to checkout. I have employed Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application and queried Sanity using GROQ. Additionally, I have added a map feature to the delivery page using react-native-maps.

I am currently focused on the development of the profile page, payment system, and delivery functionality. I plan to use Firebase Analytics to monitor traffic on the application and gather valuable insights.
